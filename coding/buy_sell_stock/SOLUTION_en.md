## Solution for buy and sell stocks

We need to find out the maximum difference (which will be the maximum profit) between two numbers in the given array. Also, the second number (selling price) must be larger than the first one (buying price).

In formal terms, we need to find max(prices[j]âˆ’prices[i]), for every i and j such that j > i.

### Approach 1: Brute Force

**implementation**

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int prices[]) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                int profit = prices[j] - prices[i];
                if (profit > maxprofit)
                    maxprofit = profit;
            }
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
                profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
                if profit > max_profit:
                    max_profit = profit

        return max_profit
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1). Only two variables - maxprofit and profit are used.
